## The official 3DSlicer Extension of MOOSE 3.0

MOOSE (Multi-organ objective segmentation) is a data-centric AI solution that generates multilabel organ segmentations to facilitate systemic TB whole-person research.

## Using the Extension
1. Find the extension in the `Segmentation` category and open it. 
2. When you use the extension the first time, only the `Install Dependencies` button will be enabled. Please click it to perform the initial setup of dependencies, which includes PyTorch and MOOSE.
   * For Windows users: Please make sure that the PyTorch extension is also installed. 
   * For Linux/Unix users: The PyTorch extension is not required, as native `torch` works in most cases. 
   * The installation will take a while, and it is normal that 3DSlicer might become unresponsive during the installation.
3. After a successful installation, the `Input Volume` and `Model` selector section will be enabled. 
4. Select a volume (which has to be a CT image) and a model and click on `Run Segmentation` and wait for the process to finish.
   * Our dataset consists mostly of total/whole body CT images. We **strongly** recommend to use only CT images with a similar field of view.
   * The `clin_ct_body_composition` model requires the L3 region of vertebrae to be in the field of view. If the model does not generate a segmentation, the field of view of the CT might be not suitable.
5. After the process finished, you will be able to select the segmentation and display/work with/modify it as you please.
   * The expected compute time of total/whole body CTs with a GPU is around 60 seconds.
   * With only CPU enabled, it might take up to 40 minutes.

## Available Segmentation Models ðŸ§¬
